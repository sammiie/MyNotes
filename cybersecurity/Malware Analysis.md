# Tools

- ### Reverse Engineering Malware Linux (Remnux)
    - is a Linux distribution purpose-built for malware analysis. It has many tools required for malware analysis already installed on it.
    - [Remnux](https://docs.remnux.org/)

- ### OS monitoring software, for example
    - Procmon
    - ProcExplorer or 
    - Regshot


- ### Sandboxes
    - ### Open Source Sandboxes
        - [Cuckoo's Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/)
        - [CAPE Sandbox](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2)

    - ### Online Sandboxes
        - [Online Cuckoo sandbox](https://cuckoo.cert.ee/)
        - [Online CAPE Sandbox](https://www.capesandbox.com/)
        - [Any.run](https://any.run/)
        - [Intezer](https://analyze.intezer.com/)

# Static Analysis
- different properties of the PE file are analyzed without running it
- Similarly, in the case of a malicious document, exploring the document's properties without analyzing
- Examples of static analysis include 
    - checking for strings in malware
    - checking the PE header for information related to different sections or
    - looking at the code using a disassemble.
- ### Examining the file type
    - **file command**
    ```bash
    file [filename]
    ```
    - **Strings command**
    ```bash
    strings [filename]
    ```

    - the output can be save to file for proper examination
    
        ```bash
        strings [filename]>output_filename
        ```
- ### Calculating Hashes

    ```bash
    md5sum filename
    ```

    - We can search for the hash we calculated for the file on online scanner such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
    - *it is recommended to search for the malware's hash instead of uploading online to avoid leaking sensitive information online*

- ### Analyzing PE header
    - PE File Header contains the metadata about a Portable Executable file. This data can help us find a lot of helpful information to help us in our analysis.
    - ### using pecheck utility
        - We can use the pecheck utility present in the Remnux to check the PE header
        ```bash
        pecheck [filename]
        ```

# Dynamic Analysis
- Malware can often hide its properties to thwart Static Analysis. However, in most of those cases, Dynamic Analysis can prove fruitful.
- Dynamic analysis techniques include running the malware in a VM, either in a manual fashion with tools installed to monitor the malware's activity or in the form of sandboxes that perform this task automatically.
